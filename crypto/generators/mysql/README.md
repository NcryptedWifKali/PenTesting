mysql generator
===============

Currently only supports new password hashes (old_passwords = Off)

Benchmarks
----------

Tests carried out using 2.4GHZ Intel i5 CPU

1. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 21.21 seconds (47144.00/s) using 1 thread
2. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 13.97 seconds (71557.64/s) using 2 threads
3. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 10.99 seconds (91025.77/s) using 3 threads
4. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 10.29 seconds (97148.53/s) using 4 threads

Benchmarks Update 06/2012
-------------------------

Tests carried out on 2.5GHZ Intel i5 CPU (Sandy Bridge)
Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2450M CPU @ 2.50GHz python 2.7.3 on Fedora 17 x64

1. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 14.61 seconds (68433.93/s) using 1 threads
2. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 7.72 seconds (129552.71/s) using 2 threads 
3. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 6.86 seconds (145739.88/s) using 3 threads
4. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 6.52 seconds (153324.12/s) using 4 threads

Now that's a heck of a jump, nearly 60k more password hashes per second on 4 threads compared to a previous generarion i5, now I have nvidia optimus I think I may well install bumblebee and see if I can get some some even higher results in cuda threads.

Conclusion
----------

Biggest performance jump is from 1 to 2 threads, diminishing returns from that point (allthough this is most likely due to HyperThreading!)
