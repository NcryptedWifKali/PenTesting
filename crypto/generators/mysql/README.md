mysql generator
===============

Currently only supports new password hashes (old_passwords = Off)

Benchmarks
----------

Tests carried out using 2.4GHZ Intel i5 CPU

1. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 21.21 seconds (47144.00/s) using 1 thread
2. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 13.97 seconds (71557.64/s) using 2 threads
3. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 10.99 seconds (91025.77/s) using 3 threads
4. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 10.29 seconds (97148.53/s) using 4 threads

Conclusion
----------

Biggest performance jump is from 1 to 2 threads, diminishing returns from that point (allthough this is most likely due to HyperThreading!)
