Benchmarks
----------

Tests carried out using 2.4GHZ Intel i5 CPU

1. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 24.05 seconds (41572.65/s) using 1 threads
2. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 14.20 seconds (70424.98/s) using 2 threads
3. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 11.54 seconds (86642.35/s) using 3 threads
4. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 11.54 seconds (86689.65/s) using 4 threads


Conclusion
----------

1. Biggest performance gain is using 2 threads yielding a x1.694 increase in words per second.
2. The smallest performance gain is using 4 threads over 3 yielding a x1.0001 increase in words per second.

the i5 cpu is dual core and hyper threaded, yielding 2 real and 2 'virtual' cpu cores, as can be seen from the above, the i series CPUs tend to suffer
from performance degredation when trying to use all of the available cores, In other projects I have noted similar behaviour in the i7 series CPUs

In other tests when trying to run 4 simultaneous video stream transcodes the I/O wait can be visibly seen through truncation of video, as such I recomend only running up to 3 threads, on i series CPUs
