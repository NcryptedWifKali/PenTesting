Benchmarks
----------

Tests carried out using 2.4GHZ Intel i5 CPU

1. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 24.63 seconds (40607.50/s) using 1 threads
2. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 14.93 seconds (66966.14/s) using 2 threads
3. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 12.82 seconds (78012.41/s) using 3 threads
4. Completed hashing of 1000000 words in 12.06 seconds (82943.40/s) using 4 threads

Conclusion
----------

1. Biggest performance gain is using 2 threads yielding a x1.65 increase in words per second.
2. Unlike [md5][2] sha256 seems to scale much better asynchronously, getting consistent gains per extra thread (allthough obviously diminishing returns).
