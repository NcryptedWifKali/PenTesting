=========

Nyancrack eats words and poops rainbows!

nyancrack uses python's multiprocessing library, consuming a wordlist to produce rainbow tables, to limit memory usage it does this using a circular buffer, once the buffer becomes full, threads are spawned to process the data.

Ruby version
++++++++++++

Tests carried out using 2.4GHZ Intel i5 CPU (Ruby parallel @ 20/01/2012)

4.  Completed hashing of 959621 words in 110.07 seconds (8718.28/s) using 4 threads.

I have not done futher testing, whilst the ruby script is a mere 16 lines long (not including lib length of course) compared to the pythons 75 lines (though the python does have benchmarking code within), the performance is ~10% that of the python script, I would like to assume that it is my ruby code at fault.

Worse still there has been a loss of 40379 words in the outputted hash list, or a 4.04% data loss, I can not at this moment fathom why.

Command used: `ruby ./csv_gen.rb > dummy_hashes.rb.txt` I will not be looking at ruby for crypto purposes untill I can resolve this issue.


Conclusion
----------

1. Biggest performance gain is using 2 threads yielding a x1.694 increase in words per second.
2. The smallest performance gain is using 4 threads over 3 yielding a x1.0001 increase in words per second.

the i5 cpu is dual core and hyper threaded, yielding 2 real and 2 'virtual' cpu cores, as can be seen from the above, the i series CPUs tend to suffer
from performance degredation when trying to use all of the available cores, In other projects I have noted similar behaviour in the i7 series CPUs

In other tests when trying to run 4 simultaneous video stream transcodes the I/O wait can be visibly seen through truncation of video, as such I recomend only running up to 3 threads, on i series CPUs
