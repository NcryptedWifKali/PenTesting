nyancrack
=========

Nyancrack eats words and poops rainbows!

nyancrack uses python's multiprocessing library, consuming a wordlist to produce rainbow tables, to limit memory usage it does this using a circular buffer, once the buffer becomes full, threads are spawned to process the data.

Improvements
------------

1. Animated colour nyancat progress indicator of course!
2. cuda intrgration and comparitive benchmarks
3. example rainbow method demonstraing salt integration
4. removal of arbitary 10000 work circular buffer in favour of run time specified memory size, i.e. -m 1024 to allocate 1gb to the buffer
5. explore a c / go port of nyancrack
